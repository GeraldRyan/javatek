Given an ArrayList of distinct integers lst, and target_sum t,
create a method that returns the ArrayList of indexes for 
the pairs of integers in the ArrayList whose sum is equal to t.
Expected time complexity: O(n)
Expected space complexity: O(n)

example:
input: [5, 8, 3, 9, 0], 8
output: [0, 2, 1, 4]

input: [1, 8, 33, 6], 7
output: [0, 3]
